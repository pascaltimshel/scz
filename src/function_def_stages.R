###
# *ERROR* in inclusion of '1 yrs' in 's8' - discovered 03/12/2015*
# this is affecting 16 samples (from 1 donor) that are put in the wrong bin.
# this means that 's7' (Late infancy) consists of only 10 samples instead of 10+16=26 samples. 
# Likewise, 's8' (Early childhood) has 16 too many samples (current size=44+16=60). 's8' should be of size 44
stages[["s7"]] = c("10 mos") # 7 6-18 months Late infancy
stages[["s8"]] = c("1 yrs","2 yrs","3 yrs","4 yrs") # 8 19 months-5 yrs Early childhood
